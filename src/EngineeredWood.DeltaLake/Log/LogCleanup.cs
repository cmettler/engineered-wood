/// <c>_delta_log</c> grew for the life of a table: every scan replays or lists commits that a checkpoint
/// already subsumes. Measured on S3, a dead commit costs ~10 ms per scan, so an hourly model adds ~90 s of
/// pure metadata to every read after a year. Nothing about that is recoverable by the reader — the files

/// <para><b>The rule, from Delta's <c>MetadataCleanup</c>.</b> A log file may be deleted only when BOTH
/// hold: a checkpoint exists AFTER it, and it is older than <c>now - logRetentionDuration</c>. The first
/// is what makes deletion safe at all — a commit no checkpoint covers is the only copy of its actions, and
/// removing it makes the table unreadable rather than merely older. With no <c>_last_checkpoint</c> this
/// deletes NOTHING, which is also Delta's behaviour.</para>

/// <para><b>⚠ Deletion is a contiguous PREFIX, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy.</b> Replay
/// demands unbroken coverage from the checkpoint onward, and a reader that meets a HOLE reports the table

/// one would produce exactly that, so the walk stops at the first file it may not delete instead of

        // modification time is not GREATER than its predecessor's to predecessor + 1 ms. A reader doing
        // time-travel-BY-TIMESTAMP therefore depends on the file its answer was adjusted from: delete that
        // and the same timestamp query starts answering with a different version.
        //
        // This library's own time travel is immune — GetSnapshotAtTimestampAsync reads the IN-COMMIT
        // timestamp out of the actions and never consults file metadata — but a Delta reader on the same
        // table is not, so the anchor is not ours to break.
        //
        // ⚠ It only matters for a SURVIVOR: if a file's dependent is ALSO being deleted, no reader can ask
        // about it. So rather than reproduce Delta's buffering iterator, walk the cut BACK over the chain
        // the first survivor depends on. Uniform timestamps therefore retain everything, which is the safe
        // direction and self-correcting — the next checkpoint retries with a different boundary.
