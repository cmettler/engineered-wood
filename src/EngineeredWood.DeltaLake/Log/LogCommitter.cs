/// <summary>
/// The Delta optimistic-concurrency commit loop: attempt, and on a collision decide whether the commit is
/// still valid at the version a concurrent writer just took.
///
/// <para><see cref="TransactionLog.WriteCommitAsync"/> gives the primitive underneath — one writer creates
/// version N and everyone else fails — but a writer that stops there can only ever report "someone beat
/// me". This is the layer that turns that into an answer: read the commits that landed since, ask the
/// <see cref="ConflictChecker"/> whether any of them invalidated what this transaction read or removed,
/// and either abort (first committer wins) or rebase onto the newer version and retry. A commit that
/// rebases is committing the SAME work at a later version, which is sound precisely because the check
/// found nothing it depended on had moved.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What it owns.</b> Protocol gating before the first write, the retry loop, the conflict verdict,
/// the post-commit snapshot refresh, and checkpoint-on-interval. What it deliberately does NOT own is the
/// meaning of the actions: it never inspects them beyond handing them to the log, so a caller with a data
/// plane of its own — its own parquet, its own statistics, its own deletion vectors — can use this without
/// bringing one along.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What a caller must still do.</b> Actions whose CONTENT depends on the version they land at
/// cannot simply be re-committed. Either mark the request <see cref="LogCommitRequest.RebaseSafe"/> false,
/// so a collision aborts rather than writes something quietly wrong, or supply an
/// <see cref="ICommitRebaseHandler"/> that re-derives them. Row tracking and deletion vectors are the two
/// cases in practice; the table layer implements both.</para>
///
/// <para>Stateless and reusable across commits. Safe to share between callers that do not otherwise
/// interfere — the loop's only mutable state is per-call.</para>
