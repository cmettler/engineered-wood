/// it was started at (see <see cref="DeltaTable.StartTransaction"/>).
///
/// <para>Stage read-dependent operations on it, then <see cref="CommitAsync"/>. At commit the
/// transaction is validated against every commit that landed since it started: if none invalidated
/// what it read, it commits — rebasing onto the newer version if another writer got there first —
/// otherwise it aborts with a <see cref="DeltaConflictException"/>. This is the standard Delta
/// OptimisticTransaction shape: record a read version, do the work, and let the commit fail only when a
/// concurrent change actually conflicts, rather than on every race.</para>
///
/// <para>The transaction holds a read snapshot; concurrent commits by others (including via the same
/// <see cref="DeltaTable"/> handle) do not disturb it. It is single-use — once committed it cannot be
/// reused. Not thread-safe: drive one transaction from one thread, though many transactions may race
/// across threads, which is the point.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Staging writes files; abandoning it takes them back.</b> A staged append's parquet, a staged
/// update's post-image, deletion vectors and change files are all on storage BEFORE
/// <see cref="CommitAsync"/> — nothing is visible until the commit, but the bytes are there. So the
/// transaction is <see cref="IAsyncDisposable"/>: <c>await using var txn = table.StartTransaction();</c>
/// deletes them if the transaction is refused, aborts, or is simply dropped on an exception path, and does
/// nothing at all once a commit has succeeded. <see cref="AbortAsync"/> is the same cleanup, named. Without
/// one of the two, every abandoned transaction's files sit on storage until VACUUM's retention horizon
/// passes — a crash-looping producer's whole batch, on every restart.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Scope.</b> Appends (<see cref="WriteAsync"/>), deletes (<see cref="DeleteAsync"/>), and
/// updates (<see cref="UpdateAsync"/>) can be staged, including several on one transaction. An append is
/// a blind write with no read dependency, so two concurrent transactional appends both land; a
/// delete/update reads the files it rewrites, so it aborts only if a concurrent commit removed one of
/// them — and a delete of DIFFERENT rows in a file someone else also deleted from reconciles row-by-row
/// rather than aborting, including across a concurrent compaction that rewrote the file away. Row ids stay
/// correct throughout: staged work reserves a contiguous range, and a rebase re-derives it against the
/// advanced high-water mark. Overwrite modes are not stageable — they remove the whole active set, which
/// is exactly what a rebase cannot re-derive.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Host-staged work.</b> A host that owns its own data plane — its own parquet codec behind
/// <see cref="IDataFileWriter"/>, its own engine deciding which rows to delete — stages work it has
/// ALREADY done rather than handing over batches and predicates: <see cref="StageDataFiles"/>,
/// <see cref="StageRowDeletesAsync"/>, <see cref="StageSchemaChange"/>,
/// <see cref="StageChangeDataAsync"/>, and <see cref="StageActions"/>. These commit through the same
