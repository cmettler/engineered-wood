/// Pluggable data-file <b>reader</b> — the read-side counterpart of <see cref="IDataFileWriter"/>. When set on
/// <see cref="DeltaTableOptions.DataFileReader"/>, the Delta table delegates the decoding of each parquet data
/// file to this reader (e.g. a host's native <c>read_parquet</c>) instead of its built-in
/// <c>ParquetFileReader</c>; everything ABOVE the raw decode stays in the Delta layer — column-mapping rename,
/// deletion-vector filtering, schema-evolution backfill, partition-column re-add, type widening, the transient
/// rowid, and row-tracking materialization. Together with <see cref="IDataFileWriter"/> this completes the
/// codec seam: the Delta layer owns the <c>_delta_log</c> protocol, the host owns the parquet bytes in BOTH
/// directions (which is what makes copy-on-write rewrites and compaction preserve codec-specific column
/// representations the built-in reader is blind to, e.g. the parquet VARIANT logical-type annotation).
