"""PySpark + delta-spark interop driver for the EngineeredWood Delta test suite.

Invoked as:  python spark_driver.py <command> <json-args-file> [json-result-file]
Writes a single JSON object to the result file (or stdout if omitted), same contract as
delta_rs_driver.py.

The result must go to a FILE, not stdout: Spark's JVM writes "SUCCESS: The process with PID ...
has been terminated." directly to the inherited stdout descriptor on shutdown, which no
Python-level redirection can prevent, and that trailing text corrupts the JSON.

This is tier 3: the reference implementation. It is the only tier that exercises writer
features, DESCRIBE DETAIL, clustering and OPTIMIZE, and the only one that reads
column-mapped tables written with the legacy minReader=2/minWriter=5 numbering.

COST: starting a JVM and a SparkSession costs roughly 15-20 seconds. Two ways to run:

  one-shot:  spark_driver.py <command> <args-file> [result-file]
  serve:     spark_driver.py serve

`serve` keeps ONE SparkSession alive and processes commands from stdin, which is what the test
suite uses -- it turns a per-test 15-20s startup into a single one for the whole run. One-shot
remains for manual debugging.

Even so, commands are coarse-grained on purpose: each does a whole scenario rather than a
single operation. Do not split a command into two just to make it read nicer.

SERVE PROTOCOL. One request per stdin line: `<command> <args-file> <result-file>`. The result is
written to `<result-file>.tmp` and then atomically renamed, so the file never exists in a partial
state; a `__EW_DONE__<name>` marker then goes to the real stdout so the caller can stop waiting
without polling. Anything Spark prints to stdout is noise the caller scans past -- which is
exactly why the payload travels by file and only the wakeup goes through stdout.
