    // ── Logical rebase / ConflictChecker parity — pr-4 LogicalRebaseTests ──

    // UN-PARKED (integration): the end-to-end transaction path — a transaction that reads, has a
    // concurrent commit land in the log, then either rebases onto it and commits or aborts — is now live
    // in DeltaTransactionTests (two overlapping transactions: disjoint files both commit, same file the
    // second aborts). Remaining gap: that path currently covers DELETE only; staging appends/updates on
    // a transaction, and row-level (same-file disjoint-row) concurrency, are still parked below.

    // are live in RowLevelConcurrencyTests. DV positions are stable across a concurrent DV-delete, so no row
    // tracking is needed for that half.
    //
    // UN-PARKED (sub-problem B — remap across a rewrite): a delete whose target file was concurrently
    // COMPACTED or UPDATE-rewritten is now relocated by STABLE ROW ID onto the new file (requires row
    // tracking), and a target row concurrently deleted/updated is a row-level conflict — all live in
