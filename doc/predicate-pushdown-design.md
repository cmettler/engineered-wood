# Expression and Predicate Pushdown Design

## Overview

Several format readers and writers in EngineeredWood have an overlapping need for
expressions: trees of typed values, column references, comparisons, and boolean
combinators. The current and planned uses are:

| Use case | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Manifest evaluation | Iceberg | Skip data files using min/max stats per field ID |
| Row group pruning | Parquet | Skip row groups using min/max stats and bloom filters |
| Stripe pruning | ORC | Skip stripes using stripe statistics (future) |
| Partition pruning | Delta Lake | Skip files whose partition values can't satisfy a filter |
| Stats-based file pruning | Delta Lake | Skip files using `AddFile.stats` min/max |
| CHECK constraints | Delta Lake | Validate every row satisfies a boolean expression on write |
| Generated columns | Delta Lake | Compute a column's value from an expression on write |
| Row-level delete / update | Lance | Select the rows a predicate-based DML statement touches |
| Post-filter | Any reader | Drop rows that survived coarse pruning but don't match |

This document covers the architecture for unifying these needs across formats and
the implementation phases to get there.

**Implementation status.** Phases 1–8 are implemented and shipping: the shared
`EngineeredWood.Expressions` library (tree, `LiteralValue`, `ExpressionBinder`,
`StatisticsEvaluator`), statistics-based pruning for Parquet (row groups + bloom
filters) and Delta Lake (partition + stats in one unified pass), Iceberg
migrated onto the shared library, and the Arrow-based row evaluator in
`EngineeredWood.Expressions.Arrow`. Phases 9–14 (SparkSql parser, Delta
CHECK/generated-column wiring, Parquet column/offset index, ORC stripe pruning)
are not yet started. See the phase table at the bottom for per-phase status.

**Reading this document.** It was written before any of it existed, and the body
still describes the destination rather than the current tree — the code samples
below are design sketches, not extracts. Where a section describes something
that has not shipped, it now says so inline. The two places where the built
result diverges from the sketch are the row evaluator's consumers (see
"Used by") and its bounded column-type coverage.

When this document was first written, only Iceberg had an expression tree —
Parquet had a design but no implementation, and ORC, Delta, and the row-level
evaluator had nothing. The sections that follow describe the architecture that
was proposed then and has since been built out through Phase 8.

## Architecture

Two evaluation models share a single expression tree:

- **Statistics-based pruning** is coarse and three-valued (`MightMatch` /
  `CannotMatch` / `Unknown`). It runs against aggregated stats — min/max, null
  count, distinct count — for a file, row group, or stripe. No row data is read.
- **Row-level evaluation** is exact and two-valued. It runs against an Arrow
  `RecordBatch` and produces a `BooleanArray`, one bit per row. Used by CHECK
  constraints, generated columns, and post-filtering.

Both consume the same `Expression` tree. The split falls on a clean dependency
boundary: stats evaluation only needs typed value comparison; row evaluation
needs Arrow.

```

ANTLR sits at the leaves. Format libraries depend on the core expression library;
they never see the parser. Delta Lake takes an optional
`IExpressionParser` (or `Func<string, Expression>`) on table open. Consumers who
don't need CHECK constraints or generated columns never reference the Spark
parser package and never pull in ANTLR.

### Why not one library per concern?

- **Stats evaluation without Arrow** is genuinely useful (metadata-only tools,
  query planners deciding which files to distribute to workers).
- **Row evaluation without stats** is the natural Delta Lake CHECK path.
- Forcing an Arrow dependency on stats consumers, or a stats dependency on row
  consumers, creates needless coupling.
- Two small libraries with a clear upstream/downstream relationship is simpler
  than one library with conditional Arrow references or feature flags.

## `EngineeredWood.Expressions` — Core Library

### Expression tree

Modeled on Iceberg's existing implementation (which is already proven and shaped
correctly). The tree distinguishes value-producing expressions from
boolean-producing predicates, mirroring delta-kernel-rs:

```csharp
public abstract record Expression;

// Leaf expressions
public sealed record UnboundReference(string Name) : Expression;
public sealed record BoundReference(int FieldId, string Name) : Expression;
public sealed record LiteralExpression(LiteralValue Value) : Expression;
public sealed record FunctionCall(string Name, IReadOnlyList<Expression> Arguments) : Expression;

// Boolean predicates
public abstract record Predicate : Expression;
public sealed record TruePredicate : Predicate;
public sealed record FalsePredicate : Predicate;
public sealed record AndPredicate(IReadOnlyList<Predicate> Children) : Predicate;
public sealed record OrPredicate(IReadOnlyList<Predicate> Children) : Predicate;
public sealed record NotPredicate(Predicate Child) : Predicate;
public sealed record ComparisonPredicate(Expression Left, ComparisonOperator Op, Expression Right) : Predicate;
public sealed record UnaryPredicate(Expression Operand, UnaryOperator Op) : Predicate;
public sealed record SetPredicate(Expression Operand, IReadOnlyList<LiteralValue> Values, SetOperator Op) : Predicate;
```

Operators are enums:
- `ComparisonOperator`: `Equal`, `NotEqual`, `LessThan`, `LessThanOrEqual`,
  `GreaterThan`, `GreaterThanOrEqual`, `StartsWith`, `NotStartsWith`,
  `NullSafeEqual` (Spark's `<=>`, used by generated column validation)
- `UnaryOperator`: `IsNull`, `IsNotNull`, `IsNaN`, `IsNotNaN`
- `SetOperator`: `In`, `NotIn`

Convenience factories live in a static `Expressions` class:

```csharp
public static class Expressions
{
    public static Predicate Equal(string column, LiteralValue value);
    public static Predicate GreaterThan(string column, LiteralValue value);
    public static Predicate IsNull(string column);
    public static Predicate And(params Predicate[] children);
    // etc.
}
```

### `LiteralValue` — typed scalar

A value type that wraps any comparable scalar without boxing. Supports cross-type
numeric promotion (int vs long, float vs double) via `IComparable<LiteralValue>`.

```csharp
public readonly struct LiteralValue : IComparable<LiteralValue>, IEquatable<LiteralValue>
{
    internal enum Kind : byte
    {
        Null,
        Boolean, Int32, Int64, UInt32, UInt64,
        Float, Double, Half,
        String, Binary,
        Decimal, HighPrecisionDecimal,
        DateOnly, TimeOnly, DateTimeOffset,
        Guid,
    }

    public Kind Type { get; }

    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(bool value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(int value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(long value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(uint value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(ulong value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(float value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(double value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(decimal value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(string value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(byte[] value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(DateTimeOffset value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(Guid value);
#if NET6_0_OR_GREATER
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(Half value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(DateOnly value);
    public static implicit operator LiteralValue(TimeOnly value);
#endif

    public static LiteralValue Null { get; }

    /// High-precision decimal for Decimal128/256 columns whose precision exceeds
    /// System.decimal's 28-29 digit limit.
    public static LiteralValue Decimal(BigInteger unscaledValue, int scale);

    public int CompareTo(LiteralValue other);
}
```

The implicit conversions mean call sites look like
`Expressions.Equal("name", "Alice")` — the `LiteralValue` type is invisible in
common cases.

**Why not Iceberg's existing `LiteralValue`?** Iceberg's version is a class
(boxes), doesn't support high-precision decimal, and lives in the wrong
assembly. The new struct subsumes it; Iceberg migrates to use the shared one.

### Schema binding

`UnboundReference("name")` carries a column name; `BoundReference(fieldId, name)`
carries an Iceberg-style field ID after binding. `ExpressionBinder` walks an
expression tree against a schema and replaces unbound references with bound
ones, also validating that referenced columns exist and that types make sense.

For non-Iceberg formats (Parquet, Delta, ORC), binding is optional — name-based
references work directly. Iceberg requires binding before evaluation.

### Statistics evaluator

Three-valued logic generic over the statistics carrier:

```csharp
public enum FilterResult
{
    /// All rows in this unit satisfy the predicate.
    AlwaysTrue,
    /// No rows in this unit can satisfy the predicate.
    AlwaysFalse,
    /// Some rows may satisfy the predicate; must read to determine.
    Unknown,
}

public interface IStatisticsAccessor<TStats>
{
    LiteralValue? GetMinValue(TStats stats, string column);
    LiteralValue? GetMaxValue(TStats stats, string column);
    long? GetNullCount(TStats stats, string column);
    long? GetValueCount(TStats stats, string column);
    bool IsMinExact(TStats stats, string column);
    bool IsMaxExact(TStats stats, string column);
}

public static class StatisticsEvaluator
{
    public static FilterResult Evaluate<TStats>(
        Predicate predicate,
        TStats stats,
        IStatisticsAccessor<TStats> accessor);
}
```

Each format implements `IStatisticsAccessor<TStats>` for its own stats carrier:

- Iceberg: `IStatisticsAccessor<DataFileStats>`
- Parquet: `IStatisticsAccessor<RowGroup>` (decodes physical bytes into `LiteralValue` on demand)
- Delta: `IStatisticsAccessor<ColumnStats>` (parses `JsonElement` into `LiteralValue`)
- ORC: `IStatisticsAccessor<StripeFooter>` (future)

### Three-valued evaluation rules

| Predicate | AlwaysTrue when | AlwaysFalse when |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| `Equal(col, v)` | min == max == v | v < min or v > max |
| `NotEqual(col, v)` | v < min or v > max | min == max == v |
| `GreaterThan(col, v)` | min > v | max <= v |
| `GreaterThanOrEqual(col, v)` | min >= v | max < v |
| `LessThan(col, v)` | max < v | min >= v |
| `LessThanOrEqual(col, v)` | max <= v | min > v |
| `NullSafeEqual(col, v)` | min == max == v | v < min or v > max |
| `IsNull(col)` | NullCount == ValueCount | NullCount == 0 |
| `IsNotNull(col)` | NullCount == 0 | NullCount == ValueCount |
| `In(col, vs)` | (defers to bloom filter) | all values outside [min, max] |
| `And(a, b, ...)` | all AlwaysTrue | any AlwaysFalse |
| `Or(a, b, ...)` | any AlwaysTrue | all AlwaysFalse |
| `Not(a)` | a is AlwaysFalse | a is AlwaysTrue |

When statistics are missing or the accessor returns null, the result is
`Unknown`. When `IsMinExact` or `IsMaxExact` is false (truncated statistics),
range comparisons at the boundary conservatively return `Unknown`.

## `EngineeredWood.Expressions.Arrow` — Row Evaluator

Walks an `Expression` tree against a `RecordBatch`, producing typed Arrow arrays
for value expressions and `BooleanArray` for predicates.

```csharp
public interface IRowEvaluator
{
    BooleanArray EvaluatePredicate(Predicate predicate, RecordBatch batch);
    IArrowArray EvaluateExpression(Expression expression, RecordBatch batch);
}

public sealed class ArrowRowEvaluator : IRowEvaluator
{
    public ArrowRowEvaluator(IFunctionRegistry? functions = null);
}

public interface IFunctionRegistry
{
    IArrowArray Invoke(string name, IReadOnlyList<IArrowArray> args, int rowCount);
    bool IsRegistered(string name);
}
```

The default `ArrowRowEvaluator` handles all built-in predicates and operators
(comparisons, AND/OR/NOT, IS NULL, IN, arithmetic, CAST). Format-specific
function libraries are registered via `IFunctionRegistry` — Spark SQL functions
like `YEAR`, `SUBSTRING`, `DATE_FORMAT` would come from the
`EngineeredWood.SparkSql` package's function registry. No registry ships today,
so a `FunctionCall` expression throws unless the caller supplies one.

**Column-type coverage is bounded**, which is a real constraint rather than a
detail: `Boolean`, `Int8/16/32/64`, `UInt8/16/32/64`, `Float`, `Double`,
`String`, `Binary`, `Date32/64`, `Timestamp`, and `Decimal32/64/128/256`. A
predicate over any other column type — `Time32`/`Time64`, `HalfFloat`, or a
nested column — throws `NotSupportedException` at evaluation time. Statistics
pruning is independent and broader, so pruning can succeed on a column the row
evaluator cannot evaluate.

Note that the Delta and Parquet readers narrow a decimal column to the smallest
`Decimal{32,64,128,256}Array` that fits its precision, so all four widths are
reachable; a `decimal(12,2)` arrives as `Decimal64Array`.

### Used by

Shipping today:

- **Delta Lake predicate DELETE / UPDATE**: the `Expressions.Predicate`
  overloads evaluate the predicate to a per-row mask, and the same predicate
  becomes the transaction's `ReadSet.Predicates` so concurrency conflict
  detection is precise rather than conservative.
- **Lance predicate delete / update**: `LanceTable` and `LanceDatasetWriter`
  construct an `ArrowRowEvaluator` per operation and keep only the rows the
  predicate selects.

Designed but not implemented (both blocked on the SparkSql parser, phases 9–10):

- **Delta Lake CHECK constraints**: evaluate the constraint predicate against
  every batch being written; if any row evaluates to false (or null), abort the
  write. Today `HonorWriterFeatures` detects an active constraint and **refuses
  the write** rather than evaluating it.
- **Delta Lake generated columns**: evaluate the generation expression to
  produce the column's values. Same refusal applies today.
- **Parquet post-filter**: after row group pruning identifies candidate groups,
  filter the materialized batches to drop non-matching rows.

## Parquet Predicate Pushdown

This is the original scope of this document. Parquet integration becomes
straightforward once the shared library exists.

### `ParquetReadOptions.Filter`

```csharp
public sealed class ParquetReadOptions
{
    // ... existing fields ...

    /// Filter predicate for row group pruning. Row groups whose statistics
    /// prove no rows can match are skipped entirely.
    public Predicate? Filter { get; init; }

    /// When true and a Filter is set, bloom filters are probed for equality
    /// predicates before falling back to statistics. Requires additional I/O
    /// per candidate row group. Default: false.
    public bool FilterUseBloomFilters { get; init; }
}
```

### `ParquetStatisticsAccessor`

Implements `IStatisticsAccessor<RowGroup>` for Parquet's row group metadata.
Decodes raw `byte[]` min/max from the column's physical type into `LiteralValue`
on demand using the column descriptor.

This is where Parquet's binary statistics encoding (signed vs unsigned int,
big-endian decimal, lexicographic byte arrays, NaN handling on float/double)
lives. The shared `StatisticsEvaluator` consumes typed `LiteralValue` and
doesn't need to know about physical encoding.

**Sort orders** (from the Parquet spec):

| Physical Type | Logical Type | Sort Order |
|---|---|---|
| BOOLEAN | — | Unsigned (false < true) |
| INT32 | — | Signed |
| INT32 | INT(unsigned) | Unsigned |
| INT32 | DATE | Signed |
| INT64 | — | Signed |
| INT64 | INT(unsigned) | Unsigned |
| INT64 | TIMESTAMP | Signed |
| FLOAT | — | Signed (with NaN handling) |
| DOUBLE | — | Signed (with NaN handling) |
| BYTE_ARRAY | STRING | Unsigned lexicographic |
| BYTE_ARRAY | — | Unsigned lexicographic |
| FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY | — | Unsigned lexicographic |
| FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY | DECIMAL | Big-endian signed |
| INT96 | — | Undefined (statistics unreliable) |

**Float/Double NaN handling:** Per the Parquet spec, NaN is not a valid
statistics value. If min or max is NaN, statistics are treated as absent.

### Reader integration

```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<RecordBatch> ReadAllAsync(
    IReadOnlyList<string>? columnNames = null,
    [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct = default)
{
    var metadata = await ReadMetadataAsync(ct).ConfigureAwait(false);
    var accessor = new ParquetStatisticsAccessor(_schema);

    for (int i = 0; i < metadata.RowGroups.Count; i++)
    {
        if (_options.Filter != null)
        {
            var result = StatisticsEvaluator.Evaluate(
                _options.Filter, metadata.RowGroups[i], accessor);

            if (result == FilterResult.AlwaysFalse)
                continue;

            if (_options.FilterUseBloomFilters
                && result == FilterResult.Unknown)
            {
                var bloomResult = await BloomFilterPredicateEvaluator.EvaluateAsync(
                    _options.Filter, _file, metadata.RowGroups[i], _schema, ct)
                    .ConfigureAwait(false);
                if (bloomResult == FilterResult.AlwaysFalse)
                    continue;
            }
        }

        yield return await ReadRowGroupAsync(i, columnNames, ct)
            .ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
}
```

### Bloom filter integration

`ParquetFileReader.GetCandidateRowGroupsAsync` already probes bloom filters for
a column + value list. The new `BloomFilterPredicateEvaluator` walks an
`Expression` tree to find `Equal`/`In` predicates and probes them per row
group:

1. Walk the predicate to find equality-shaped sub-predicates
2. For each, probe the bloom filter (if present) for the row group/column
3. If the bloom filter says "definitely not present" → `AlwaysFalse`
4. Otherwise, fall through to statistics

Bloom filter probing is only useful for equality and set membership. Range
predicates (`GreaterThan`, `LessThan`, etc.) cannot use bloom filters.

## Delta Lake Integration

### Stats-based file pruning

> **Implemented, but not in the shape sketched here.** Partition and statistics
> pruning were unified into a single pass in `DeltaFilePruner` rather than the
> two separate steps below, and the public entry point is
> `ReadAllAsync(columns, filter, ct)`. Two things learned after this section was
> written and worth knowing before touching it:
>
> - **Decimal bounds must not go through `System.Decimal`.**
>   `JsonElement.TryGetDecimal` and `decimal.TryParse` silently *round* a value
>   with more than 28–29 significant digits and return `true`. A rounded bound is
>   a wrong bound, a wrong bound skips a file that matches, and the query
>   silently returns fewer rows. `DeltaLiteralDecoder` parses the raw digits into
>   an unscaled `BigInteger` and materializes `System.Decimal` only when lossless.
> - **A checkpoint's typed statistics are read in preference to the JSON.**
>   `CheckpointStatsView` maps `stats_parsed` columns once per batch so a bound
>   costs one indexed read instead of parsing each file's whole statistics blob
>   inside the pruning loop. The JSON fallback is load-bearing, not vestigial:
>   `stats_parsed` omits boolean bounds.

The original design: implement `IStatisticsAccessor<ColumnStats>` for Delta's
`ColumnStats` type (parsed from `AddFile.stats` JSON), and filter
`Snapshot.ActiveFiles` before reading:

```csharp
public IAsyncEnumerable<RecordBatch> ReadAllAsync(
    Predicate? filter = null,
    IReadOnlyList<string>? columns = null,
    CancellationToken ct = default)
{
    var accessor = new DeltaStatisticsAccessor();

    foreach (var addFile in CurrentSnapshot.ActiveFiles.Values)
    {
        if (filter != null && addFile.Stats != null)
        {
            var stats = ColumnStats.Parse(addFile.Stats);
            var result = StatisticsEvaluator.Evaluate(filter, stats, accessor);
            if (result == FilterResult.AlwaysFalse)
                continue;
        }

        // Also: partition pruning based on addFile.PartitionValues
        // ...

        await foreach (var batch in ReadFileAsync(addFile, columns, ...))
            yield return batch;
    }
}
```

### CHECK constraints

> **Not implemented** (phase 10, blocked on phase 9). What ships today is the
> fail-closed guard: `DeltaTable.HonorWriterFeatures` detects an active
> `delta.constraints.*` and rejects the write rather than committing rows it
> cannot validate. The design below is the intended replacement, and
> `DeltaTableOptions.ExpressionParser` does not exist yet.

On write, parse `delta.constraints.{name}` into a `Predicate`, evaluate against
each batch, and abort if any row fails:

```csharp
foreach (var batch in batches)
{
    foreach (var (name, expr) in constraints)
    {
        var result = _rowEvaluator.Evaluate(expr, batch);
        if (HasFalseOrNull(result))
            throw new DeltaConstraintViolationException(name);
    }
    // ... write batch ...
}
```

The constraint expressions are stored as Spark SQL strings in
`Metadata.Configuration`. Parsing requires the optional
`EngineeredWood.SparkSql` package via an injected `IExpressionParser`:

```csharp
public sealed record DeltaTableOptions
{
    // ... existing ...

    /// Parser for SQL expressions in CHECK constraints and generated columns.
    /// If null and the table has CHECK constraints or generated columns, write
    /// operations will throw.
    public IExpressionParser? ExpressionParser { get; init; }
}
```

### Generated columns

> **Not implemented** (phase 10, blocked on phase 9), and refused on write the
> same way CHECK constraints are.

On write, parse `delta.generationExpression` from each generated column's
metadata. For each batch:

1. If the user provided a value for the generated column: validate
   `(materialized <=> generated) IS TRUE`
2. If the user did not provide a value: compute it via the row evaluator and
   substitute it into the batch

Same parser injection as CHECK constraints.

## `EngineeredWood.SparkSql` — ANTLR-Based Parser

A separate, optional package. Consumers who don't need CHECK constraints or
generated columns never reference it.

### Approach

Apache Spark publishes its SQL grammar as `SqlBaseParser.g4` and
`SqlBaseLexer.g4` under Apache 2.0. The full grammar is ~3,400 lines and covers
DDL, DML, queries, and expressions. The expression subset we need is a small
fraction:

- `expression` → `booleanExpression` → `predicated` → `valueExpression`
- `valueExpression` → arithmetic, comparison
- `primaryExpression` → literals, CAST, CASE, function calls, column refs
- Supporting rules: `comparisonOperator`, `predicate`, `dataType`,
  `identifier`, `qualifiedName`, `whenClause`, `constant`

Total: roughly 200 lines of parser rules + 100 lines of lexer tokens.

### Subsetting tool

A small program parses the upstream `SqlBaseParser.g4` grammar, walks rule
references starting from `expression`, and emits a self-contained subset
grammar. Rerun the tool against each new Spark release to pick up additions.

This avoids:
- Hand-maintaining a fork (drift over time)
- Depending on a third-party SQL parser whose Spark-dialect coverage is
  approximate (SqlParser-cs, etc.)
- Pulling ANTLR into the bottom of the dependency stack — it lives only in this
  optional leaf package.

### Translation layer

A visitor walks ANTLR's CST and produces `EngineeredWood.Expressions`
`Expression` nodes. Function calls become `FunctionCall(name, args)`; the
`SparkFunctionRegistry` provides Arrow-backed implementations for the standard
Spark functions used in Delta expressions (`CAST`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`,
`HOUR`, `SUBSTRING`, `DATE_FORMAT`, `CONCAT`, `COALESCE`, `IF`, etc.).

### Function set

Minimum viable set for CHECK constraints and generated columns:

- Type casting: `CAST`, `TRY_CAST`
- Date/time: `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `DATE_FORMAT`, `CURRENT_DATE`,
  `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- String: `SUBSTRING`, `CONCAT`, `LENGTH`, `TRIM`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`
- Null handling: `COALESCE`, `IFNULL`, `NULLIF`
- Conditional: `CASE/WHEN/THEN/ELSE/END`, `IF`
- Comparison: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `<=>` (null-safe), `BETWEEN`,
  `IN`, `LIKE`
- Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- IS predicates: `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `IS TRUE`, `IS FALSE`

## Future: Page-Level Pushdown via Column/Offset Index

| Index | Content | Enables |
|---|---|---|
| **Column Index** | Min/max values and null counts per page within a column chunk | Page-level statistics evaluation — skip pages that can't match |
| **Offset Index** | Byte offset and row range of each page within a column chunk | Seeking directly to matching pages without scanning headers |

Composes naturally with row group pruning: pruning eliminates row groups, the
column index identifies pages within surviving groups, the offset index
provides byte ranges to read only matching pages. The same `Predicate` tree is
evaluated per-page with the same `StatisticsEvaluator`.

This is a separate body of work — requires parsing column/offset index Thrift
structures, a page-skipping read path in `ColumnChunkReader`, and writing the
indexes in `ColumnChunkWriter`.

### Ordering rationale

Phases 1-7 are the natural progression of "build the core, prove it on the two
formats with concrete needs (Parquet pruning, Delta pruning), and migrate
Iceberg to consume it." Each phase is independently testable and shippable.

Phases 8-10 extend the architecture to row-level evaluation, unblocking CHECK
constraints and generated columns. The Spark parser is pure leaf work and can
proceed in parallel with anything earlier.

Phases 11-14 are advanced optimization (page-level pruning) and additional
format support (ORC). Defer until the simpler wins land.

### Testing strategy

- **Unit tests:** `LiteralValue` comparison across all type pairs and edge
  cases (NaN, decimal precision, string ordering)
- **Unit tests:** `StatisticsEvaluator` against synthetic stats with known
  min/max/null_count for each predicate variant
- **Unit tests:** `ParquetStatisticsAccessor` decoding of physical bytes for
  every (physical_type, logical_type, sort_order) combination
- **Round-trip tests:** Write Parquet files with known data distributions, read
  with filters, assert correct row group pruning
- **Cross-validation:** Compare pruning decisions against PyArrow's
  `read_table(filters=...)` or DuckDB's predicate pushdown on the same files
- **Edge cases:** Empty statistics, all-null columns, single-row row groups,
  NaN in float columns, truncated min/max, Decimal256 statistics
- **Iceberg parity:** After migration, all existing Iceberg expression tests
  must still pass

## Open Questions

1. **Where does `EngineeredWood.Expressions` live in the dependency graph?** It
   has no Arrow dependency, so it could sit alongside `EngineeredWood.Core`. It
   does not need to depend on Core itself unless we want to share types like
   `IMemoryOwner<byte>` (we don't, for the expression layer). Recommendation:
   sibling of Core, no mutual dependency.

2. **Should `Predicate` and `Expression` be separate hierarchies, or should
   `Predicate` be a tag interface on `Expression`?** delta-kernel-rs separates
   them; Iceberg merges them (`AndExpression` extends `Expression`). Separation
   is more type-safe (you can't accidentally use a value expression where a
   predicate is required) but creates two parallel hierarchies. Recommendation:
   separate, with `Predicate` as a subclass of `Expression` for cases that
   need to mix them (function arguments, CASE branches).

3. **Should the Iceberg migration happen before or after Parquet pushdown?**
   Resolved: Iceberg migrated first (Phase 4 before Phase 5), as
   recommended. The API shape held up against the existing Iceberg tests
   before Parquet and Delta consumers were added.

4. **Bloom filter probing automatic or opt-in?** Requires I/O even when stats
   alone prove `AlwaysFalse`. Recommendation: opt-in via
   `FilterUseBloomFilters`, as proposed.

5. **Should `ReadRowGroupAsync` also accept a filter?** Currently only
   `ReadAllAsync` would use it. Defer until page-level pushdown exists.
