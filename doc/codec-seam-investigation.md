# The codec seam (`IDataFileWriter` / `IDataFileReader`) — investigation

**Status: the seam decision is settled; some of the audit findings are not.**

The decision was whether to keep a narrow **codec** seam (`IDataFileReader` / `IDataFileWriter`, bytes ⇄
Arrow batches) or a broader **execution** seam (`IDataFileRewriter`, which delegated DML semantics to the
host's SQL engine). The codec seam stayed and the execution seam was never taken; the downstream consumer
subsequently adopted the codec seam plus row-id DML, so `IDataFileRewriter` exists nowhere — not in
EngineeredWood, not upstream. §6–7 record *why* the line falls where it does, which is what matters if
widening the seam is ever proposed again.

**What remains open is the keep-and-fix half: the contract obligations in §5.3–7.** They are real gaps in
a shipping `[Experimental]` API, and `CodecSeamTests` still covers no partitioned case, which is why
several of them went unnoticed.

Two sections are historical and marked as such: §5.1 (a variant-registration bug that was retracted — the
path was unreachable, and Delta-layer variant support has since landed anyway) and §5.2 (a copy-on-write
UPDATE writing to the wrong directory, fixed). Their original reasoning is preserved because the *shape*
of each mistake is instructive.

  the exchange of 2026-07-19.
- The downstream consumer, published 2026-07-19: `https://github.com/cmettler/fabricator-extension`
  — a DuckDB extension hosting a C# bridge over CoreCLR. Its `docs/native-delta-write.md` (the design
  doc for the whole effort) and `docs/variant-support.md` are the primary evidence.
- Our own `9302723` (the seam as landed), `CodecSeamTests.cs`, and the `pr-4` branch for
  `IDataFileRewriter`.

## 1. The headline: the seam is not about VARIANT

The rationale recorded in the landing notes — *"working assumption: the seam comes out once the variant
extension is registered"* — is falsified by the downstream source.

- **Chronology.** `IDataFileWriter` landed **2026-07-04** as phase P1 of a planned architectural
  inversion. VARIANT landed **2026-07-06** and explicitly *reused* the already-existing seam:
  `docs/variant-support.md` says *"UPDATE / copy-on-write DELETE / OPTIMIZE — LIFTED via the
  `IDataFileReader` codec seam (second pass)."* Variant is a passenger, not the driver.
- **cmettler's own words** in the PR thread: *"This is a simple abstraction to plugin a different
  parquet codec. I simply use the duckdb COPY with format parquet in `IDataFileWriter`."*
- **The stated motivation** (`docs/native-delta-write.md` §1) is about our Parquet layer:

  > Every engineered-wood defect this project hit lived in its **parquet layer**, never its
  > `_delta_log` layer: decimal read corruption, the RoaringBitmap DV byte format,
  > DataPage-V2-by-default, signed min/max without `column_orders`, missing `path_in_schema`, the
  > copy-on-write footer bugs. [...] This **de-risks the part of engineered-wood whose future is
  > uncertain** (its parquet codec) while keeping the part that is genuinely good.

Registering the variant extension on the Delta layer's internal Parquet interop therefore closes the
*variant* gap but does not remove the seam's reason to exist.

## 2. What the slogan gets right and wrong

"DuckDB writes the data, engineered-wood writes the log" is the downstream **aspiration**, close to
verbatim (`§12`: *"engineered-wood shrinks to the log/protocol/DV-bitmap layer [...] every parquet byte
— read and write — is DuckDB's"*). As a description of the seam **as landed** it oversimplifies three
ways:

1. **EW still writes data files.** Deletion-vector bitmaps are data, and EW writes those bytes; the
   seam is not involved in a DV delete at all. Same for CDF `_change_data/` parquet (deferred
   downstream — "CDF tables keep the EW-read path").
2. **Everything data-shaped above the byte layer stays in EW.** By the time `WriteAsync` is called, EW
   has already done the partition split, the logical→physical column-mapping rename, and row-tracking
   materialization (`__delta_row_id` is in `physicalBatch` *before* the writer sees it — which is why
   row tracking on append works for free downstream). EW computes `add.stats` itself afterward via
   `StatsCollector`. The read side is symmetric: `IDataFileReader` returns raw batches and DV
   filtering / logical rename / type widening / partition re-add / schema-evolution backfill all stay
   above the decode in `ProcessFileBatchesAsync`.
3. **The real line is parquet serialization vs. everything else** — a much smaller job than "the data."

## 3. Taxonomy of the gaps

### Category 1 — EW feature/quality gaps (closeable; mostly closed)

- **Bloom filters.** EW writes none. DuckDB writes them on dict-encoded columns; downstream uses their
  presence as a native-write fingerprint.
- **The correctness bugs**: decimal read corruption, DV byte format, DataPage-V2-by-default, signed
  min/max without `column_orders`, missing `path_in_schema`, null-struct definition/value
  misalignment, all-null pages declaring a delta encoding with a 0-byte payload, thrift field dispatch
  desync. All closeable, and most have since landed.
- **VARIANT annotation on write + extension registration on the Delta layer's reader.** Open — see §5.

Category 1 is not a standing argument for the seam. It is a maturity delta at a point in time; every
item is a bug or missing feature with a known fix.

### Category 2 — genuine boundary limits (not Arrow's type system; the seam's *shape*)

Arrow-the-type-system held up. VARIANT initially failed to cross with `Unsupported Arrow type VARIANT`,
but that was fixed by registering an Arrow extension type; the blob-instead-of-struct transport
(`ew.variant_transport`) works around an upstream **DuckDB appender bug** (`ArrowAppender::FinalizeChild`
walks the logical type's 4 children against an appender built for the internal type), not an Arrow
limitation.

What genuinely does not fit is the `IReadOnlyList<RecordBatch>` contract:

- **Materialization.** ~~`WriteAsync` takes a realized batch list — the whole file in memory.~~ **Half
  fixed (2026-07-20):** `WriteAsync` now takes `IAsyncEnumerable<RecordBatch>` (symmetric with the
  streaming `IDataFileReader.ReadAsync`), so a host may consume a file's batches incrementally instead of
  the interface forcing the whole file into memory; EW passes a lazy enumerable (a rewrite still collects
  survivors internally for `StatsCollector`, but that is EW's business, not the contract's). What remains
  is the **one-call-per-file** shape: downstream's `RunCopyPartitioned` (streaming `COPY … PARTITION_BY …
  APPEND true`, bounded memory, *many files from one pass*) is still **not** expressible on the interface.
- **The C-ABI crossing itself.** `RunCopySql` (clustered OPTIMIZE) runs the per-file read, the global
  `ORDER BY` (DuckDB's spilling sort) and the write inside a *single* host query so data never crosses
  into C#. `IDataFileRewriter` is the same instinct. Any batch-in/batch-out contract forecloses
  whole-query optimization by construction.

The tell: the three most interesting DuckDB entry points downstream are all *outside* the interface.

### Category 3 — where the seam is *worse* (DuckDB deficiencies, borne by the host)

- DuckDB's `COPY` **ignores Arrow field metadata**, so the host must lift `PARQUET:field_id` into an
  explicit `FIELD_IDS` clause or an id-mode column-mapping table reads all-NULL. Downstream handles
  top-level columns only; nested is unimplemented.
- `RETURN_STATS` yields **decoded VARCHAR** min/max whose float rounding could produce a too-narrow min
  and skip live rows — so downstream routes stats back through EW's `StatsCollector` anyway.
- Single-file `COPY` **does not create parent directories**.
- A SQL-NULL variant written via DuckDB reads back in Spark as a variant JSON-null.

### Category 4 — risk posture (not a gap; no feature work closes it)

Downstream's own framing is a bet on a battle-tested implementation plus an explicit hedge against
EW's direction being unsettled. If category 1 closes and their trust follows, the seam becomes optional
for them; if it does not, they keep it regardless of parity. This is the category that actually decides
whether the seam is permanent.

## 4. Division of labour on the DML path (as built downstream)

DuckDB never generates DV bitmaps, and it also does not rewrite everything.

- **EW writes every DV bitmap.** A sweep of the bridge found no DV writing; the rewriter only
  *consumes* DV positions (passed as `excludePositions` so a CoW UPDATE on a DV table touches only
  live rows). `§12` assigns "deletion-vector bitmap bytes" to EW outright.
- **DuckDB supplies row positions, not bitmaps.** The DML mechanism is the transient rowid
  `(fileOrdinal << 40) | file_row_number` from DuckDB's scan; C# decodes matched rowids to
  `(file, positions)` and EW encodes the DV. DuckDB answers "which rows," EW answers "what bytes."
- **Under DV mode a delete rewrites nothing** — *"DV-mode DELETE is unchanged (no data rewrite →
  native writer N/A)"*. DV became the **default** DML mode downstream on 2026-07-04. UPDATE on a DV
  table is merge-on-read (DV-delete the old rows, append a small post-image file), so the writer emits
  only that small append.

Remaining true rewrites through the seam: **copy-on-write UPDATE on non-DV tables**, and
**compaction / OPTIMIZE**. On the default path, the DELETE path — whose correctness bugs were the most
painful — stays entirely EW's. This is also why DV composes cleanly with row tracking: no rewrite means
positions, row ids and commit versions are preserved for free, with no materialized columns.

## 5. Defects and gaps found while auditing (independent of the decision)

1. ~~**Variant registration gap — a data-integrity bug.**~~ **RETRACTED (2026-07-19) — not a bug.**
   The first version of this document claimed a compaction or copy-on-write rewrite would silently
   strip the VARIANT annotation, on the grounds that `DeltaTableOptions.ParquetReadOptions` defaults to
   `ParquetReadOptions.Default` (null `ExtensionRegistry`) while the Parquet layer's VARIANT decode is
   gated on that registry. The premise is true; **the conclusion does not follow, because the code path
   is unreachable.** The Delta *schema* layer rejects a variant column in both directions, before any
   parquet reader is constructed:
   - **Read**: a Spark/Delta 4.x `"variant"` schema type hits the default arm of
     `SchemaConverter.ParsePrimitive` → `DeltaFormatException("Unknown Delta primitive type: variant")`
     (`SchemaConverter.cs:100-101`).
   - **Write**: `VariantType` derives from `ExtensionType`, **not** `StructType` (verified against
     Apache.Arrow 23.0.0 by reflection), so it matches no arm of `FromArrowType` and falls through to
     `DeltaFormatException("Cannot convert Arrow type ... to Delta type.")` (`SchemaConverter.cs:170-171`).

   So engineered-wood already fails closed, and `pr-4`'s `ThrowIfVariantRewrite` guard has nothing to
   guard here. Pinned by `SchemaConverterTests.VariantDeltaType_IsRejected_NotSilentlyMappedToStruct`
   and `...VariantArrowType_IsRejected_NotSilentlyMappedToStruct`, which also assert the
   not-StructType-derived property directly — if `VariantType` ever became struct-derived upstream, the
   `ArrowStructType` arm *would* silently convert it to a Delta `struct<metadata,value>`, and that is the
   real latent hazard worth watching.

   What remains at the Delta layer is a **feature gap, not a defect**: a `"variant"` Delta type in
   `SchemaConverter`, the `variantType` table feature in `ProtocolVersions` and `RequiredSchemaFeatures`,
   and shredded read/write — i.e. PR #4's `VariantTransport` slice. Only *then* does the registry default
   on the Delta read path become a live question.

   **UPDATE (2026-07-21) — the feature gap above is now CLOSED, and the schema-rejection premise no longer
   holds.** Delta-layer variant support landed after this section was written (independently of the
   seam decision). Concretely, everything the paragraph above listed as "what remains" now exists:
   - `SchemaConverter` maps `"variant"` in **both** directions and no longer throws: read
     `"variant" => VariantType.Default` (`SchemaConverter.cs:106`), write
     `VariantType => new PrimitiveType { TypeName = "variant" }` (`:145`). The cited
     `..._IsRejected_NotSilentlyMappedToStruct` tests were accordingly replaced with
     `VariantDeltaType_MapsToTheArrowVariantExtension` / `VariantArrowType_MapsBackToTheDeltaVariantTypeName`
     / `VariantRoundTrips_ThroughBothConvertersAndTheSerializer` — of the opposite polarity, but they KEEP
     the `VariantType`-is-not-`StructType`-derived assertion, so the latent-hazard watch this section called
     out survives.
   - `variantType` is in `SupportedReaderFeatures` / `SupportedWriterFeatures`, and `RequiredSchemaFeatures`
     fires the protocol upgrade when a variant column appears.
   - The "registry default becomes a live question" worry is resolved by construction: the Delta read path
     ALWAYS registers the variant extension into its read options (`DeltaTable.WithVariantExtension`), so a
     caller's null-`ExtensionRegistry` default never reaches the parquet reader on a Delta table.

   That also retires the retracted §5.1 bug's underpinning: it was declared *unreachable because variant was
   rejected*, but variant is now *reached and handled* rather than rejected. Preservation through the rewrite
   paths this section worried about is now pinned directly — `Compaction_OfVariantTable_PreservesValues` and
   `Delete_OnVariantTable_PreservesTheExtensionType` (plus `VariantInteropTests` cross-validating on Spark /
   delta-rs); `DeltaTableOptions.EmitVariantLogicalType` controls whether the annotation is emitted on write
   (`VariantColumnCoercion.StripAnnotation` when off). So this whole item is historical: no defect,
   no remaining feature gap. The seam decision in §6–7 is unaffected — variant was always a passenger (§1),
   not the seam's reason to exist.

   **But the investigation it prompted did find a real one, at the Parquet layer — see 1a.**

1a. **Shredded VARIANT columns silently materialised as EMPTY values (Parquet layer) — FIXED
   (2026-07-19).** Was reachable by anyone who set `ParquetReadOptions.ExtensionRegistry` and read a
   Spark- or DuckDB-written variant column — both shred by default.

   **The defect.** The reader wrapped a shredded column as a `VariantArray` but performed **no
   reassembly**. For a partially-shredded row the `value` child is empty and the data lives in
   `typed_value`, so `GetValueBytes` returned **zero bytes while `IsNull` reported false** — a valid row
   holding an empty variant. No exception, no warning. Only the fully-shredded layout (no `value` child
   at all) threw, and Apache.Arrow's own message there named the fix: *"Use the shredding-aware readers
   in `Apache.Arrow.Operations.Shredding`."* Measured against `parquet-testing/shredded_variant`:
   **61 of 131 readable cases failed value comparison.**

   **Why it went unnoticed.** `SweepTest_ShreddedVariantCorpus_AllReadAsVariantArray` asserts only that
   schema annotation and array wrapping *agree*, plus that some column reports `IsShredded`. It never
   reads a value. It passed for months on a corpus it could not decode — and the corpus ships
   `*_row-N.variant.bin` reference bytes that no test compared against. Worth remembering as a pattern:
   a green sweep test is not evidence for the thing its name implies.

   **The fix.** `Parquet/Data/VariantShredding.cs` reassembles each row via `Apache.Arrow.Operations`
   23.0.0 (new `PackageReference`; ships net462/netstandard2.0/net8.0, covering every TFM, and the
   net10.0 AOT/trim gate stays warning-free). `NestedAssembler` calls it immediately after wrapping.
   The output is an ordinary unshredded `VariantArray`: values correct and uniform, but the shredded
   layout is not preserved, so a caller cannot inspect `typed_value` afterwards. That trade is
   deliberate and documented on the type — the reader's contract is to materialise values the caller can
   read without taking a second dependency. If preserving the layout is ever needed (predicate pushdown
   into `typed_value`), it should be an explicit opt-in on `ParquetReadOptions`, not the default.

   **Verification** — `VariantCorpus_MatchesReferenceVariants`, driven by the corpus's own `cases.json`:
   135 rows match semantically, 36 byte-exact, and all 6 declared error cases now **throw** (malformed
   shredding — conflicting `value`/`typed_value`, non-object values with shredded fields, unsupported
   shredded types — was previously accepted and turned into garbage, so this is a second correctness
   gain). Two assertion strengths on purpose: semantic comparison everywhere, because reassembly
   legitimately re-canonicalizes metadata (offset-size bits, dictionary pruning); byte-exactness
   additionally for unshredded columns, which pass through untouched. The three cases the corpus marks
   *"not valid according to the spec and implementations can choose to error, or read the shredded
   value"* are treated as implementation-defined — Arrow reads the shredded value where Iceberg prefers
   the residual, and both are conformant.

   **Sequencing consequence (now unblocked).** Delta variant support could not have been built on the
   old foundation: a Delta reader that merely registered the extension would have inherited silent
   empty-value reads for every Spark-written column.
2. ~~**CoW UPDATE writes to the wrong directory on partitioned tables.**~~ **FIXED (2026-07-20)**, and
   independent of the seam decision. `ComputeUpdateActionsAsync` built the rewrite filename as a bare
   `{Guid:N}.parquet` at the table root while the add copied `addFile.PartitionValues`. Now it joins the
   source's partition directory (reuse the source path's encoded prefix verbatim; decode for the physical
   write), mirroring the compaction rewrite — so a host codec receives the correct partitioned `fileName`
   too. Measured: delta-rs read the root-dropped file fine (partition values are authoritative from the log),
   so it was a spec-layout bug, not data loss.
3. **`relativePath` encoding is unspecified and the call sites disagree.** The reader's XML doc says
   "URL-decoded"; the writer's says nothing. `DeltaTable.cs` (write path) passes the **raw** name;
   `CompactionExecutor` passes an explicitly `DeltaPath.Decode`d one. They agree only because both
   happen to be the on-disk form. Downstream consumes the path verbatim (`Replace('\\','/')
   .TrimStart('/')`, no unescape anywhere in the bridge), so the de facto contract is
   **decoded / on-disk**. State it in both docs and make the write path consistent.
4. **Directory creation is an unstated obligation.** EW never creates partition directories; the
   built-in path works only because `LocalTableFileSystem.CreateAsync` calls `Directory.CreateDirectory`
   implicitly. Downstream discovered this and mkdir -p's itself, best-effort and non-fatal (object
   stores have implicit directories). Note their own `RunCopySql` skips the mkdir their `RunCopy` does
   — an illustration of how easy the obligation is to miss.
5. **Field metadata on the handed-off batch is load-bearing and undocumented.** `PARQUET:field_id`
   (id-mode column mapping) and `ARROW:extension:*` (host type discrimination — the reason
   `CleanField` preserves them) both matter to the host, and the contract says nothing.
6. **`CodecSeamTests` does not cover partitioned tables through the seam at all**, which is why 2–4
   went unnoticed.
7. **A host codec faces schema evolution itself, unstated.** The read path hands its projection straight
   to the host decoder, so EW cannot intersect that list against the file's real columns the way the
   built-in path now does. A column added by a later `AddColumnAsync` is absent from older files; the
   built-in reader backfills it as NULL, but a host decoder asked for it will fail or return nothing
   depending on its own behaviour. The obligation belongs in the contract.

## 6. Why the seam is codec-shaped

The two candidate seams were not the same kind of commitment:

- `IDataFileWriter` / `IDataFileReader` are a **codec** seam — narrow, honest, roughly what the slogan
  describes once "data" is shrunk to "bytes."
- `IDataFileRewriter` is an **execution** seam. It delegates *semantics*, not encoding: the DELETE
  predicate, the UPDATE join and value substitution, schema-evolution NULL backfill, and
  row-id/commit-version computation all move into DuckDB SQL. It is also the interface that cannot be
  honoured without row-tracking-through-rewrite (which did not exist when the decision was taken), and it
  declines column-mapped and schema-evolved files anyway. Leaving it out was right.

Because the seam stayed, what follows from it: it is a **per-file, materialized, batch-in contract**, and
that should be explicit. Hosts wanting streaming partitioned writes or in-engine sort/filter will keep
going around it, as the downstream consumer already does with three non-interface entry points. Widening
it toward "hand me a query plan" is a categorically larger API and not the right shape for EW — §7 says
why. The `ProcessFileBatchesAsync` extraction underneath the seam is behaviour-preserving and would have
been worth keeping under either outcome.

The obligations that survive the decision are §5.3–7; §5.1 was retracted (no bug), §5.1a and §5.2 are
fixed.

## 7. Where an execution seam would earn its keep

The analysis that decided §6, kept because it is the argument to answer if widening the seam is ever
proposed. The question it turns on is **who owns query execution for DML**.

**The observation.** `IDataFileReader`/`IDataFileWriter` sit at the CODEC level (Arrow batch ⇄ parquet
bytes). `IDataFileRewriter` sits at the EXECUTION level — it runs the DELETE filter / UPDATE substitution in
DuckDB SQL (`read_parquet(… file_row_number) WHERE file_row_number NOT IN (…)`, a `LEFT JOIN` for UPDATE).
Two levels in one seam. Whether that is an *inconsistency* depends entirely on which boundary you think the
seam draws.

**Framing 1 — the seam is "parquet serialization" (codec).** Then the rewriter is the odd one out, and the
consistent split is: keep reader+writer, **drop the rewriter**, and model the remaining true rewrites
(copy-on-write UPDATE on non-DV tables; per-file compaction) as **read → transform-in-EW → write**. Every
seam becomes bytes↔batches; EW owns all DML semantics, which also deletes the rewriter's column-mapping /
schema-evolution / row-tracking-through-rewrite coupling. Grounded: DV is the DEFAULT DML mode downstream, so
the rewriter is already off the default path (a DV DELETE writes only a bitmap; UPDATE is merge-on-read), and
the highest-value native rewrite — clustered OPTIMIZE with a whole-query `ORDER BY` — already runs OUTSIDE
the interface. What you give up is DuckDB executing the DML transform in SQL — which is exactly what made the
seam an execution seam. **This framing assumes EW is the DML front-end** (a C# caller supplies the
predicate/updater as delegates).

**Framing 2 — the seam is "compute + bulk IO" (DuckDB is the query engine).** Then reader (DuckDB scans),
writer (DuckDB encodes) and rewriter (DuckDB transforms) are ALL "DuckDB does compute; EW owns `_delta_log` +
DV bitmaps + stats + OCC" — consistent along the OWNERSHIP axis, differing only in data shape
(batch / batch / operation). Here the rewriter is not an anomaly; it is the DML member of a compute seam, and
you would expect MORE execution entry points, not fewer. **This framing assumes DuckDB is the DML front-end**
(users write SQL against Delta tables; the extension is DuckDB-native) — which is what fabricator actually is.

**Where the execution seam solves something genuinely hard in EW — the deciding case: joins and MERGE.**
This is the test that separates the framings, because it is where "transform-in-EW" stops being a pure
per-row function and becomes a *relational* computation against data EW does not have:

- **Read-side joins** (`SELECT … FROM delta JOIN duck_table …`) are clean under either framing: DuckDB scans
  the Delta table (file list + DV positions from EW) and joins in DuckDB. No rewrite; the codec reader suffices.
- **Write-side joins / MERGE** are the hard case. `UPDATE delta SET x = d.y FROM duck_table d WHERE
  delta.k = d.k`, or a full `MERGE … WHEN MATCHED UPDATE/DELETE WHEN NOT MATCHED INSERT`, derives the new
  values (and the matched set) from a JOIN against another table. Under **Framing 1**, EW would have to pull
  the source table into Arrow and run the join **in C#** — a spilling hash-join executor EW does not have and
  should not grow; it would be re-implementing DuckDB. Under **Framing 2** the rewriter is the natural
  vehicle: DuckDB evaluates the join / `SET` expression (against any DuckDB table, subquery, function or UDF),
  keys the new values by transient rowid, and the rewrite applies them — exactly the `LEFT JOIN against
  (position → new SET values)` shape fabricator already uses. MERGE composes from the three seams the host
  orchestrates: matched-update via the rewriter, not-matched-insert via the writer, matched-delete via a DV.

  The general principle: **the execution seam earns its keep exactly when the DML transform is a query, not a
  pure function of the source row** — joins, MERGE, correlated subqueries, SQL/UDF-rich `SET`/`WHERE`,
  aggregation-derived updates. A codec-only seam can only carry transforms EW can express as a delegate; once
  the front-end is SQL, re-hosting those semantics in EW is a non-goal.

**So the decision is really: who owns query execution for DML?** If EW is (or should stay) the DML
front-end, Framing 1 (codec-only) is cleaner and smaller, and joins/MERGE are simply out of scope. If a
DuckDB-fronted Delta table that participates in joins and MERGE against DuckDB tables is a capability worth
having, Framing 2 is the architecture, the rewriter is consistent within it, and "a more consistent split"
means *naming the compute-vs-metadata boundary and expecting execution entry points* — not collapsing to
codec. The mismatch this section opened with is a mismatch only under Framing 1; under Framing 2 it dissolves.

Either framing keeps the §5.3–7 codec obligations, and either can ship without the rewriter — Framing 1
permanently, Framing 2 until join/MERGE DML is actually wanted. What should not happen is keeping an
execution seam while *assuming* Framing 1: an abstraction-level mismatch with no owning story.

**How it resolved.** Framing 1's deciding case — "update from a host-side join" — is served directly on
the codec side: read stable row addresses, join host-side, then `UpdateByRowIdsAsync(updates)` with a
rowid-keyed value batch (type-agnostic substitution via concat + take). That gave the hard case a concrete
API without an execution seam, which is what settled §6. If join/MERGE DML against host tables ever
becomes a goal, this section is the argument to re-open — the principle above (an execution seam earns its
keep exactly when the transform is a *query*, not a pure function of the source row) is the test to apply.
