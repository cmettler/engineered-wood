# Known Issues and Feature Gaps

This document tracks feature gaps and known runtime issues, grouped by
feature area. Within each area, gaps are split into **Missing features**
(things the spec defines that we do not implement) and
**Correctness / interop issues** (behavior where our code diverges from
the spec in a way that affects round-tripping with other tools).

For implementation status of the expression library and predicate
pushdown, see [`predicate-pushdown-design.md`](predicate-pushdown-design.md).
For the forward-looking encryption design, see
[`encryption-design.md`](encryption-design.md).

## Parquet

### Missing features

**Modular encryption (PARQUET-1375).** Neither reading nor writing of
encrypted Parquet files is implemented. Encrypted test files are skipped
by the test sweeps. See [`encryption-design.md`](encryption-design.md).

**Column Index / Offset Index.** Not parsed on read and not produced on
write. Pushdown granularity is the row group; files we write do not carry
page indexes. Tracked as phases 11–13 in
[`predicate-pushdown-design.md`](predicate-pushdown-design.md).

**LZO compression.** `CompressionCodec.Lzo` is defined and decoded from
Thrift, but `Decompressor.Decompress` in
`src/EngineeredWood.Core/Compression/Decompressor.cs` has no case for it
and throws `NotSupportedException`. Any file with LZO-compressed pages
fails to read.

**Logical / Converted type handling on read:**

- `INTERVAL` (12-byte FLBA) is not mapped to an Arrow type. Files with
  `ConvertedType.Interval` fall through to raw `FixedSizeBinaryType(12)`.
- `BSON` logical type decodes but is not mapped in
  `ArrowSchemaConverter`; falls through to `BinaryType`.

**Logical type emission on write:**

- `UUID` is not emitted. Arrow `FixedSizeBinaryType(16)` is written as a
  plain FLBA with no annotation in `ArrowToSchemaConverter`.
- `JSON` and `ENUM` are never emitted (Arrow has no enum type and we
  always write `StringType` as `StringType`).

**Geospatial types.** The `GEOMETRY` / `GEOGRAPHY` types added to the
Parquet spec in late 2024 are not supported on either path.

**Variant — supported.** The `VARIANT` logical type is read and written
(the `arrow.parquet.variant` Arrow extension ⇄ a VARIANT-annotated
group; the thrift annotation carries the required
`specification_version = 1` — Spark rejects the empty form). Unshredded
round-trips at the Parquet layer (`VariantArrayRoundTripTests`); full
SHREDDED read/write lives at the Delta layer (`VariantTransport` over
`Apache.Arrow.Operations` — infer/shred on write, per-row reassembly on
read), cross-validated against Spark 4.x, delta-kernel and DuckDB.

**Encoding strategies on write.** The decoder supports
`BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT` for `INT32`/`INT64`/`FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY`, but
`EncodingStrategyResolver` never emits BSS for these types — only for
`FLOAT`/`DOUBLE`. V1 data pages always emit `PLAIN` regardless of type.

**Arrow types rejected on write.** `ArrowToSchemaConverter.MapArrowType`
throws `NotSupportedException` for `Date64Type`, `IntervalType` (any
unit), `DurationType`, `DictionaryType`, `UnionType`, `FixedSizeListType`,
and `ListViewType`.

**Metadata fields not produced on write:**

- `ColumnMetaData.encoding_stats` (field 13) is never populated.
- `ColumnMetaData.key_value_metadata` (field 8, per-column) is neither
  read nor written.
- `RowGroup.SortingColumns` can be encoded and decoded but
  `ParquetWriteOptions` exposes no API to set it, so callers cannot
  produce sorted row groups with a sort manifest.
- `Statistics.distinct_count` is never computed or written.

### Correctness / interop issues

**TIME units — fixed.** `TIME` maps to the Arrow-correct width per
unit: millis → `Time32`, micros/nanos → `Time64` (previously a
malformed `Time32(Microsecond)` with nanos truncated).

**Decimals always surface as Decimal128/256 on read (deliberate).**
The reader widens every decimal to the classic `Decimal128` (≤ 38
digits) / `Decimal256` regardless of the parquet physical width — the
narrow Arrow `Decimal32`/`Decimal64` types are mishandled by consumers
of the Arrow C interface, and widening the unscaled value is lossless.
Precision/scale are preserved; callers expecting the narrow types get
the wide ones.

**ALP encoding: decode only.** The (proposed) ALP-encoded float/double
pages decode bit-exact (validated against apache/parquet-testing
PR #100's arade/spotify1 reference data — the fetch recipe is in
`AlpDecoderTests`); the writer never emits ALP.

**Deprecated `min`/`max` restricted to signed-order types.** The
deprecated `Statistics.min`/`max` fields (defined with signed byte
ordering) are emitted only for types whose logical ordering IS the
signed ordering (booleans, signed ints incl. date/time/timestamp,
floats); UTF-8 / binary / unsigned / decimal-FLBA columns get only
`min_value`/`max_value` (parquet-mr behavior), so a legacy signed-order
reader can no longer mis-prune them.

### Known runtime issue: concatenated Gzip members on .NET Framework

**Status:** Open — workaround in place, fix requires third-party Gzip
library.
**Affected targets:** `netstandard2.0` when consumed by .NET Framework 4.x.
**Not affected:** .NET 8+, .NET Core 3.0+.

.NET Framework's `System.IO.Compression.GZipStream` does not correctly
handle Gzip streams containing multiple concatenated members as permitted
by RFC 1952. After decompressing the first member, it stops reading and
over-reads the underlying stream, making subsequent members inaccessible.

Some Parquet writers — notably Apache parquet-mr — produce Gzip-compressed
data pages with multiple concatenated Gzip members. Normal Gzip-compressed
Parquet files (single member per page) work correctly on all platforms;
only the concatenated-member edge case is affected.

The test file `parquet-testing/data/concatenated_gzip_members.parquet`
triggers this issue. `GzipCompressed_ReadsTestFile` is skipped on
netstandard2.0/net472 via `#if !NET8_0_OR_GREATER` in `ReadRowGroupTests.cs`.
The round-trip Gzip test (`GzipCompressed_RoundTrip`) passes on all
platforms because our own writer produces single-member pages.

Possible fixes: use SharpZipLib or DotNetZip on netstandard2.0 (same
pattern as BrotliSharpLib for Brotli), or accept the limitation since
concatenated Gzip in pages is rare.

## ORC

### Missing features

**Column-level encryption.** Not implemented for read or write. The only
references are the generated protobuf message definitions in
`src/EngineeredWood.Orc/Proto/orc_proto.proto`; nothing consumes them.
See [`encryption-design.md`](encryption-design.md).

**Public predicate-pushdown API.** Internal bloom-filter evaluation
exists (`OrcReader.cs`, `BloomFilter/`), but `OrcReader` exposes no
`Filter`/`Predicate` option comparable to `ParquetReadOptions.Filter`.
Row indexes are written on every stripe but the reader has no
skip-to-row-group or `SeekToRow` API, so the positions are unused. The
shared expression library has not been wired in. Tracked as Phase 14 in
[`predicate-pushdown-design.md`](predicate-pushdown-design.md).

**VARCHAR / CHAR on write.** Arrow has no varchar/char type distinction,
and `OrcWriter.AddType` has no case emitting `Varchar` or `Char` —
Arrow `StringType` always maps to ORC `String`, losing any max-length
information. Reads collapse both to `StringType` too, so max-length is
never surfaced.

**RLE v1 / DictionaryV1 on write.** `RleDecoderV1` is present for read,
but there is no `RleEncoderV1`; `OrcWriterOptions.EncodingFamily` only
exposes `V2` / `DictionaryV2`. Files Hive 0.11 or other V1-only readers
can consume cannot be produced.

**Compression codecs.** `LZO` and `Brotli` are spec-defined
(`orc_proto.proto` includes both) but `OrcCompression.ToCodec` throws on
both. `LZ4` is likewise unsupported.

**ACID / transactional ORC.** The Hive 3 ACID extensions (synthetic
`originalTransaction`/`bucket`/`rowId`/`currentTransaction`/`operation`
columns, base/delta file concepts) are not implemented.

**ColumnarStripeStatistics (ORC v2 layout).** Only the v1 per-stripe
`StripeStatistics` layout is emitted and read. The v2
`ColumnarStripeStatistics` message defined in `orc_proto.proto` is
neither written nor parsed.

**Missing footer fields.** `Footer.WriterTimezone` and `Footer.Calendar`
are never set. The spec recommends `PROLEPTIC_GREGORIAN` for new writers;
without `Calendar`, Date/Timestamp interpretation is ambiguous to
conformant readers. Without `WriterTimezone`, non-instant `Timestamp`
columns cannot be correctly localized.

**Writer identification.** Both `Footer.Writer` and
`PostScript.WriterVersion` are hard-coded to `6`, which is the registered
CUDF writer code. EngineeredWood-produced files misidentify as CUDF to
conformant readers.

### Correctness / interop issues

**Timestamps use the Unix epoch instead of the ORC 2015-01-01 epoch.**
The ORC spec requires timestamp seconds to be stored as the offset from
`2015-01-01T00:00:00 UTC`. `TimestampColumnWriter` in
`src/EngineeredWood.Orc/ColumnWriters/TimestampColumnWriter.cs` writes
raw Unix epoch seconds, and `TimestampColumnReader` reads them back
as-is. Files round-trip with ourselves but are off by 1,420,070,400
seconds (≈45 years) relative to any conformant reader. The same class
also never populates the post-ORC-135 `TimestampStatistics.MinimumUtc` /
`MaximumUtc` fields, emitting only the legacy `Minimum`/`Maximum`.

**Decimal columns are effectively Decimal64.**
`DecimalColumnWriter.ReadDecimal128AsLong` reads only the low 8 bytes of
each Arrow Decimal128 value. `DecimalColumnReader` decodes the varint
into a `long`. Values whose magnitude exceeds 63 bits are silently
corrupted in both directions. Precision > 18 is not round-trip safe.
Decimal min/max statistics share the same truncation.

**Sliced / gap-containing ListArrays are written wrong.**
`ListColumnWriter.Write` emits `listArray.Values` wholesale without
slicing or respecting the offsets buffer. When the input list array is
sliced or contains nulls that leave gaps in the offsets, the written
child data includes elements that don't belong, corrupting the list
count.

**Bloom filter v1 with `Bitset.Count == 1`.** The v1 BloomFilter reader
path accepts a bitset only when `Utf8Bitset` is present or
`Bitset.Count > 1`. A legitimate v1 file with a single-chunk bitset
is rejected.

**Arrow types rejected on write.** `OrcWriter.cs` and
`ColumnWriters/ColumnWriter.cs` throw `NotSupportedException` for some
Arrow type combinations (certain union shapes, certain dictionary
configurations). The common set of primitives, nullable,
struct/list/map, decimal, date, timestamp is covered.

---

## Avro

### Missing features

**OCF codecs `bzip2` and `xz`.** Both are listed in the Avro OCF spec
but are not in `AvroCompression` / `AvroCodec`. Files using either
cannot be read or written.

**`big-decimal` logical type (Avro 1.12).** Arbitrary-precision decimal
backed by `bytes` — not supported. Decimal with precision > 38 is
silently clamped to Decimal128 by `DecimalBytesBuilder`.

**Record / enum / fixed aliases in schema resolution.**
`AvroRecordSchema.Aliases`, `EnumSchema.Aliases`, and `FixedSchema.Aliases`
are parsed but `SchemaResolver` only consults field-level aliases.
A writer schema whose record name matches a reader alias will not be
matched.

**Field `order` attribute** (`ascending` / `descending` / `ignore`).
Not parsed on read and not preserved on write. Usually readers ignore
this, but the metadata round-trip is lossy.

**Union schema evolution beyond nullable.** `SchemaResolver` only
unwraps 2-branch nullable unions. The spec's full branch-matching rules
(writer union → reader non-union pick-first-matching, reader union →
writer non-union pick-compatible) are not implemented.

**Complex-type default values.** `DefaultValueApplicator` substitutes
`null` when a missing reader field has an `array`/`map`/`record`/`fixed`
default. The spec requires JSON arrays/objects to be applied element-by-
element, and fixed defaults to be ISO-8859-1-decoded bytes. Only
primitive and enum defaults are honored.

**Schema registry integration.** `SchemaStore` is a local ID→schema map;
there is no HTTP fetch of Confluent/Apicurio endpoints. Framing is
supported (SOE, Confluent, Apicurio) but live registry lookup is the
caller's responsibility.

**Avro IDL / Protocol / RPC.** No `.avdl` parser, no protocol handshake,
no RPC. Not in scope but worth noting for discoverability.

### Correctness / interop issues

**`lz4` codec is non-standard.** The OCF spec defines
`null` / `deflate` / `bzip2` / `snappy` / `xz` / `zstandard`. LZ4 is not
in the spec. EngineeredWood exposes it (`AvroCodec.Lz4`) with a 4-byte
LE size prefix + LZ4 block framing. Files written with this codec will
not be readable by spec-compliant Avro tools.

**Recursive schemas are depth-limited.** Cyclic schemas (e.g. a linked
list where a record references itself) are blocked at depth 64 in
`ArrowSchemaConverter`, `RecordBatchAssembler`, and `SchemaResolver`.
Genuinely cyclic data structures throw on Arrow conversion.

**Schema round-trip drops fields.** `AvroSchemaWriter` omits `aliases`
on records/fields/enums/fixed, `doc` on most nodes, and enum `default`.
Round-tripping a schema through parse → write loses these attributes.

**Arrow↔Avro type mapping gaps.** `Schema/ArrowSchemaConverter.cs` and
`Data/RecordBatchEncoder.cs` throw `NotSupportedException` for some
unusual Arrow shapes. Common types are covered.

---

## Delta Lake

### Missing features

**Unsupported named features (reject writes / reads).** The following
features appear in the Delta protocol but are absent from
`SupportedReaderFeatures` / `SupportedWriterFeatures` in
`ProtocolVersions.cs`, so tables requiring them will be rejected:

| Feature | Role | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| `allowColumnDefaults` / `columnDefaults` | Writer | Column default values on write not supported. |
| `clustering` (liquid clustering) | Writer | Not supported. |
| `collations` | Writer | String collations not supported. |
| `catalogOwned` / `catalogOwned-preview` | Reader-Writer | Catalog-owned contracts not supported on either side. |
| `coordinatedCommits` / `managedCommits` | Writer | No commit-coordinator client; plain rename-based commits only. |
| `checkpointProtection` | Reader-Writer | Vacuum-guarded checkpoints not honored. |

`appendOnly`, `invariants`, `checkConstraints` and `generatedColumns`
are ALLOWLISTED (a writer-v7 upgrade enumerates the legacy features
even when inactive — merely listing them must not reject writes) and
enforced per table by `HonorWriterFeatures`: `appendOnly` rejects
non-append writes only when `delta.appendOnly = true`; invariants /
CHECK constraints / generated columns REJECT the write only when a
column or table actually declares one — their Spark SQL expressions
cannot be evaluated without the SparkSql parser (Phase 9 of the
predicate-pushdown design, not started), and writing possibly-violating
data silently would be worse. `variantType` is fully supported
(reader + writer — see the Parquet section).

**Write-side NOT NULL enforcement.** `WriteCoreAsync` does not validate
batches against the schema's declared nullability — a direct library
user can append a NULL into a `nullable: false` column (a spec
violation; Spark trusts non-nullable schemas on read). The downstream
ArrowNet bridge enforces this (top-level + nested struct/list/map
constraints) before handing data in; an in-core validation pass is the
proper home.

**Commit files must be NDJSON.** The log reader parses one action per
line per the spec. Pretty-printed multi-line JSON commit files (found
in the wild in duckdb-delta's test fixtures; delta-kernel tolerates
them) are rejected.

**`rowTracking` — fixed.** `rowTracking` is accepted as a reader
feature too, and every commit that assigns fresh `baseRowId`s (write,
external-file commit, merge-on-read update, compaction) emits the
`delta.rowTracking` domain metadata with the spec high-water mark
(highest assigned row id). Snapshot rebuild takes the max of the
domain value and the active-file derivation, so removes can no longer
regress the mark (which could have reassigned used row ids).

**Multi-part V1 checkpoints on write.** Read is supported
(`CheckpointReader.cs`); write always emits a single
`.checkpoint.parquet` (`CheckpointWriter.cs`), regardless of table size.

**Full `_last_checkpoint` parsing.** `CheckpointReader` reads only
`v2Checkpoint.path`; other fields (`sizeInBytes`, `numOfAddFiles`,
checksum, sidecar counts) are ignored. Missing validation.

**Absolute-path deletion vectors (storage type `p`).**
`DeletionVectorWriter` emits only inline (`i`) and UUID-relative (`u`)
DV references. Absolute-path DVs cannot be written. Additionally, each
delete produces a new DV file rather than packing multiple DVs into a
single file with distinct offsets, so `offset`/`sizeInBytes` are
effectively unused on write.

**Table-property honoring.** The following properties are accepted in
table metadata but not acted on by the runtime: `delta.logRetentionDuration`,
`delta.enableExpiredLogCleanup`,
`delta.randomizeFilePrefixes`, `delta.checkpointInterval` (as a table
property; the .NET option `DeltaTableOptions.CheckpointInterval` does
work), `delta.dataSkippingNumIndexedCols`, `delta.dataSkippingStatsColumns`.

**Stats collection gaps.**

- String min/max stats are truncated at 32 chars (min = prefix, max =
  prefix with its last incrementable char bumped, omitted when
  impossible) — Spark parity; unbounded strings no longer bloat commits.
- `tightBounds: false` is written on adds that carry a deletion vector
  (stats cover all physical rows, so bounds are loose); tight stats
  omit the field (default true).
- Stats recurse into STRUCT leaves (nested JSON objects per the spec;
  nullCount is exact — a row counts as null when the parent OR the child
  slot is null; min/max reuse the flat collectors, which is superset-safe
  even for parent-null slots). List/map subtrees carry no per-column
  stats (per the spec).
- `stats_parsed` is built by `StatsParsedBuilder` for checkpoint writes
  but `CheckpointReader.ExtractAdd` reads only the JSON `stats` string.

**CommitInfo.** `InCommitTimestamp.CreateCommitInfo` populates
`timestamp`, `operation`, `inCommitTimestamp`, `engineInfo`
("EngineeredWood.DeltaLake") and an `operationParameters` object.
Every commit path writes one (incl. compaction, `operation: OPTIMIZE`),
and a non-dry-run vacuum writes the Spark-parity `VACUUM START`
(retention parameters + files/bytes-to-delete metrics) / `VACUUM END`
(`status: COMPLETED` + deleted-file metrics) commitInfo-only pair.
Still never emitted: per-operation parameter payloads for the data
operations (WRITE/DELETE/UPDATE carry an empty object), `readVersion`,
`isolationLevel`, `userId`, `userName`, `txnId`, `clusterId`,
`notebook`.

**Post-creation protocol upgrades.** `CreateAsync` declares the
requested features (column mapping, deletion vectors, row tracking,
in-commit timestamps, CDF, identity, and the schema-driven
`timestampNtz`/`variantType`) at create, and `AddColumnAsync` /
`SetSchemaAsync` emit a protocol UPGRADE commit automatically when an
evolved schema first requires a schema-driven feature. There is still
no general public API for enabling an arbitrary feature
(`deletionVectors` / `rowTracking` / `typeWidening` / …) on an existing
table.

**Exactly-once transactional writes.** `SetTransaction` actions are
read, written, and reconciled in snapshots, but `DeltaTable` has no
`WriteWithTxnAsync(appId, version, ...)` overload — streaming writers
cannot use `(appId, version)` for exactly-once idempotency.

**High-level DML.** No MERGE, no UPDATE-by-predicate beyond the
existing `UpdateAsync`, no DELETE-by-predicate beyond `DeleteAsync`, no
RESTORE (committing a time-travel state as the current version), no
CLONE (shallow/deep). `ReadChangesAsync` exists for CDF but there is no
raw incremental-by-version-range read outside of CDF.

**Schema evolution API — largely present.** `AddColumnAsync` (nullable
columns; assigns a fresh column-mapping id when mapping is on),
`RenameColumnAsync` / `DropColumnAsync` (metadata-only; require column
mapping) and `SetSchemaAsync` (adopt a whole new schema — the REPLACE
primitive) are public. Still missing: column reorder, nullability
change, adding a column to a nested struct, and changing the column
mapping mode after `CreateAsync`.

**Checkpoint content gaps — fixed.** `CheckpointWriter` preserves
`add.deletionVector`, `add.tags`, `add.baseRowId`/
`defaultRowCommitVersion` and the protocol
`readerFeatures`/`writerFeatures` (dropping the DV silently resurrected
deleted rows for any reader replaying from the checkpoint), emits the
required `metaData.format.options`, writes the top-level action structs
as NULLABLE per the spec checkpoint schema (delta-kernel rejects an
always-present struct with null required children), and includes
`remove` tombstones within the retention window (snapshots track
tombstones; `delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration` is honored when
parseable, default one week). `CheckpointReader` reads all of these
back.

**Orphan deletion-vector files.** `VacuumExecutor` excludes
`_delta_log/` from deletion. Abandoned DV `.bin` files written into
`_delta_log/` are never cleaned up.

**Schema round-trip.** `SchemaConverter.FromArrowField` preserves
per-field metadata (comments, column-mapping IDs, invariants) when
converting Arrow → Delta, filtering out `PARQUET:*` transport keys
(e.g. `PARQUET:field_id`). `ToArrowField` (Delta → Arrow) preserves
metadata too (recursively), so schemas round-trip losslessly.

### Correctness / interop issues

**Partition value encoding — largely fixed.** Null partition values
are stored as JSON null in `add.partitionValues` (the directory name
uses `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`); reads decode null / the sentinel /
a missing key as a typed NULL column. Decimal partition values encode
(dot notation) and decode; timestamps emit `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` when
the fraction is zero, else `.ffffff` (both spec forms accepted on
read); numeric formatting/parsing is invariant-culture. Partition
directory names use Spark's `escapePathName` (`DeltaPath.EscapePathName`
— escapes `:` `%` `/` …, not space) and `add.path` is the URL-encoded
form of the on-disk relative path per the spec (`DeltaPath.Encode`,
decoded on every read — this also makes Spark-written tables with
escaped paths readable, and vice versa). Remaining: binary partition
values are rejected (clean error) rather than encoded; tables written
by earlier versions whose `add.path` contained literal `%XX` sequences
must be rewritten (the log form is now decoded on read).

**`timestampNtz` feature — fixed.** A schema containing a
`timestamp_ntz` column (any naive Arrow timestamp) now declares the
`timestampNtz` reader+writer feature at `CreateAsync`, and
`AddColumnAsync`/`SetSchemaAsync` emit a protocol upgrade in the same
commit when the evolved schema first introduces the type (legacy
protocol versions are upgraded to table-features mode with their
implied features enumerated). Previously the feature was omitted and
strict readers (Spark, delta-kernel) rejected the table.

**V2 sidecar discovery.** `CheckpointReader.ReadV2CheckpointAsync`
rebuilds sidecar paths as `_delta_log/_sidecars/{name}` by a slash
check, which is fragile for paths that contain slashes in unexpected
places.

---

## Iceberg

### Missing features

**Arrow / Parquet handoff.** There is no data-file writer.
`TableOperations.AppendFilesAsync` accepts pre-built `DataFile` records
from the caller; callers must write the Parquet file themselves and
compute the column stats externally. There is no equivalent of
`OutputFile.newAppender()` from Iceberg Java — EngineeredWood.Iceberg
is a metadata library that doesn't produce data files.

**Row-level operations.** No MERGE / UPDATE / DELETE API.
`AppendDeleteFilesAsync` accepts pre-built delete-file records; it does
not convert rows to position-deletes or equality-deletes.

**Partition transform functions.** The transform types (`Identity`,
`Void`, `Bucket`, `Truncate`, `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`) are
declared in `Transform.cs` but none has an `Apply(value)` implementation.
The library cannot derive partition values from input data. Bucket hash
(Murmur3 with per-type canonical bytes), truncate, and temporal
extraction are not implemented.

**V1 manifest schema.** Only the V2 manifest Avro schema is hard-coded
in `ManifestAvroSchemas.cs`. V1 manifests (required `snapshot_id`, no
sequence numbers) cannot be read or written.

**Puffin files.** Statistics sidecars (V2+) and V3 deletion-vector
sidecars are not implemented. No `Puffin/` directory, no reader, no
writer.

**Catalogs.** Only `FileSystemCatalog` and `InMemoryCatalog`. Missing:
REST, Glue, Hive, JDBC, Nessie, Polaris, Snowflake Open Catalog.

**Delete-file application.** `ScanResult.DeleteFiles` surfaces delete
files but the reader does not apply them. No position-delete / equality-
delete row filtering, no sequence-number filtering (data file's
sequence < delete's sequence), no V3 deletion-vector reader.

**Scan planning surface.** `TableScan` lacks `AsOfTimestamp()`
(supported in `TimeTravel` but not wired to `TableScan`), incremental
scans (`(startSnapshot, endSnapshot)` appends-between), per-file
residual predicates, branch/tag ref selection, and split-by-size / task
planning.

**Metadata operations.** No `SortOrderUpdate`. `SchemaUpdate` has no
column-reorder, no add-to-nested-struct, no `ALTER COLUMN … FIRST/AFTER`.
No format-version upgrade API.

**Iceberg views and materialized views.** Not implemented.

**Manifest compaction / merging.** No API.

**Iceberg table encryption.** `key_metadata` on manifest-list entries is
always written null (`ManifestIO.cs`). No KMS / wrapped-key plumbing.

### Correctness / interop issues

**Manifest Avro codec is severely truncated.**
`ManifestIO.EncodeDataFile` and `DecodeDataFile` omit the following
fields (some declared on `DataFile` but `[JsonIgnore]`d and absent from
the Avro codec):

- `partition` (written as an empty record, 0 bytes — single-partition tuple)
- `lower_bounds`, `upper_bounds` — stats pruning in `TableScan` only
  works for manifests whose `DataFileStats` were built in-process;
  manifests read from Avro have null bounds
- `nan_value_counts`, `distinct_counts`
- `key_metadata`, `equality_ids`, `referenced_data_file`
- `content_offset`, `content_size_in_bytes` (V2+)
- `first_row_id`, `spec_id` (V3)

Manifests EngineeredWood writes are not consumable by other Iceberg
tools (the schema is truncated and does not match the declared V2
schema), and manifests written by other tools lose bounds and partition
tuples when decoded here.

**Manifest-list partition summaries written null.** `ManifestIO`
encodes manifest-list `partitions` as null, so manifest-list-level
partition pruning (skipping entire manifests) cannot be performed by
downstream readers.

**No byte encoders for lower/upper bounds.** Even if the manifest codec
were complete, the library has no canonical-byte encoder for Iceberg
types (date, timestamp, decimal, string, binary, uuid, etc.), so
callers cannot correctly construct bounds to hand in.

**V3 features are declarative only.** `NestedField`'s initial-default
and write-default fields are parsed but never applied on read for
missing columns. `TableMetadata.NextRowId` is stored but never
incremented on appends, so V3 row lineage is not enforceable.
`DataFile.FirstRowId` exists but is not in the Avro codec.
`last-updated-sequence-number` is not tracked per row.

**V3 type declarations without I/O support.** `IcebergType.cs` declares
all 22 primitive/nested types (including geometry, geography, variant,
timestamp_ns, timestamptz_ns), but without a data-file writer, there is
no write-side validation that any of these types are correctly encoded
in Parquet, and no Iceberg-side schema bridge to Arrow or Parquet.

---

## Expressions

### Missing features

**Spark SQL parser.** `EngineeredWood.SparkSql` (Phase 9 of the
predicate-pushdown design) is not implemented. `Expression` /
`Predicate` trees must be built in code via the `Expressions` static
factory. This blocks any feature that needs to parse SQL expression
strings from table metadata — notably Delta CHECK constraints and
generated columns.

**Built-in function registry.** `ArrowRowEvaluator` accepts an optional
`IFunctionRegistry`, but the library ships no implementations.
`FunctionCall` expressions throw at evaluation time unless the caller
supplies a registry. A Spark function registry is planned alongside the
SparkSql parser.
